# my listings (holds all listings created by the user)
# add listings (adds listings to the database and displays on front page)
# Log Out button
# delete listings (in the my listings tab, if you right click, you can delete a listing)
# search feature works again
# Login pages decorated

needs to be done:
# make it so that when you click on a listing that isn't yours, you get taken to a swapping page.
# on this swapping page, you have to propose one of your listings to swap with the other user.
# this should go onto a pending trade page in the same drop down menu as 'my listing' and 'add listing'.
# on this page you can accept/deny trades that other people have made for your listings and see your pending swap proposals.
